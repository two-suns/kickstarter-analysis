However, Louise will need to carefully consider her goal for the play, as the failed Kickstarters appeared to have goals that were too high. Her goal of $12000 is above the mean of $10554 for kickstarters that failed. The estimated goal for her musical of Â£4000 may succeed as is, but it would be best if she could get it under that amount as it is close to the mean.
